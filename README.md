# find_min_max_func
PostgreSQL find_min_max_func w/e C code

This repo contains 2 main functions:
1-) Finding the minimum and maximum values with PostgreSQL function among the given unlimited number of records.
File = Find_min_max_Postgre_internal.sql

2-) Same as the first one but PostgreSQL functions created with C code. ( Uncomplete )

--> With C code there are several approaches.
  -> With Arrays
  -> With using Point
  -> With using struct
  -> Until now, I could not write a suitable script or scripts to put here.
